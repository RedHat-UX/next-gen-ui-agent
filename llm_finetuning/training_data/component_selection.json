        "question": "I have an array of product objects with name, price, description, and stock. What UI component should I use?",
        "answer": "For an array of product objects with multiple fields, use a **table** component. Tables are ideal for displaying structured data with multiple columns across many rows. This allows users to scan, compare, and sort products easily. Each product becomes a row, and fields like name, price, description, and stock become columns."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an array of product objects with name, price, description, and stock. What UI component should I use if user explicitly asks in his query to see the products in a table?",
        "answer": "Use a **table** component. Array data can be shown in table, and user explicitly asked for it."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an array of product objects with name, price, description, and stock. What UI component should I use if user explicitly asks in his query to see the products as a set of cards?",
        "answer": "Use a **set-of-cards** component. Array data can be shown in set of cards, and user explicitly asked for it."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an array of product objects with name, price, description, and stock. What UI component should I use if user explicitly asks in his query to see the products as a one card?",
        "answer": "One-card component is not suitable for this use case, because it is suited for displaying one item data, and we have array data. Use component suitable for array data, for example **set-of-cards** or **table** or some chart component, depending on structure of the data and other requirements in the user query."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an array of product objects with name, price, description, and stock. What UI component should I use if user do not explicitly asks to show the products in a table or a set of cards?",
        "answer": "Use UI component which suits the best data structure and other requirements in the user query."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have a single user profile object with name, email, avatar URL, and bio. Which component should I display this with?",
        "answer": "For a single object with structured information, use a **one-card** component. A card is perfect for displaying one item with multiple attributes in a visually organized way. It provides clear hierarchy and makes the profile information easy to read at a glance. It also allows to display an image together with other attributes, which is avatar URL in this case."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have a single user profile object with name, email, avatar URL, and bio. Which component should I display if user explicitly asks in his query to see the profile in a table?",
        "answer": "Single object with structured information can't be shown as a table. Use a **one-card** component, because it is suited for displaying one item data."
    },
    {
        "question": "My data is an array of employee objects and the user wants to compare salaries across departments. What should I show?",
        "answer": "Use a **table** component for this use case. When users need to compare values across multiple records, tables excel at displaying the data in a scannable format. You can add sorting and filtering capabilities to help users analyze salary data by department, making comparisons straightforward. Salary and department attributes are the most important fields to be displayed in the table in this case, together with some user info like name."
    },
    {
        "question": "I received data object with an image URL like 'https://example.com/photo.jpg' and user would like to see the image only. What component should render this?",
        "answer": "Use an **image** component. When your data contains an image URL, the image will be fetched and displayed properly. This component may support features like zoom, full-screen view, and loading states. This provides the best user experience for viewing the image only."
    },
    {
        "question": "The data object contains a YouTube video URL 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123' as `trailer` field, and user wants to see video. How should this be displayed?",
        "answer": "Use a **video-player** component. For video URLs (YouTube, Vimeo, or direct video links), a video player component provides the best user experience."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an array of blog post objects with title, excerpt, author, and thumbnail URL. The user wants to browse them. What UI component fits best?",
        "answer": "Use a **set-of-cards** component. When displaying multiple items that have rich content like longer texts and image, cards work better than tables. Each blog post gets its own card, showing the thumbnail, title, excerpt, and author in a visually appealing layout that's easy to browse. But set-of-cards is not good for items comparation, table is better for this use case."
    },
    {
        "question": "My data shows monthly sales figures over the past year as an array of {month, amount}. The user wants to see the trend. What should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-line** component. Line charts are ideal for showing trends over time. With months on the x-axis and sales amounts on the y-axis, users can easily see patterns, growth, or decline in sales. Line charts make temporal data and trends immediately visible."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have data showing market share percentages for 5 companies. What chart type should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-pie** or **chart-donut** component. Both are perfect for showing proportions and parts of a whole. When you have percentage data that adds up to 100%, pie/donut charts make it easy to visualize each company's relative market share at a glance. Donut charts are slightly more modern and leave space for a total in the center if it is not 100%."
    },
    {
        "question": "The user wants to compare revenue across different product categories. I have an array of {category, revenue}. What component?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-bar** component (vertical or horizontal bars). Bar charts are excellent for comparing values across categories. Each category gets a bar whose height/length represents the revenue, making it easy to see which products generate the most revenue. This is more effective than a table for visual comparison."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have a single notification object with message, timestamp, and priority. How should this be displayed?",
        "answer": "Use a **one-card** component. A card is ideal for displaying a single notification with its various attributes. You can style the card based on priority (colors for urgent/normal), show the message prominently, and include the timestamp. Cards provide good visual separation and hierarchy for single items."
    },
    {
        "question": "My data is an array of image URLs from a photo gallery. What's the best way to show these?",
        "answer": "Use an **images-gallery** component (which is a specialized collection of image viewers). For multiple images, a gallery with thumbnails provides the best experience. Users can browse thumbnails and click to view full-size images. This is better than showing one image viewer or a table of URLs. If gallery component is not available, you can also use **set-of-cards** component to show the images in cards. If gallery component is available, it is better to use it than set-of-cards component, because it provides better user experience for browsing images."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have quarterly profit data for 3 years. The user wants to see how profits changed. What chart should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-line**. Line charts excel at showing change over time across multiple periods. With quarters/years on the x-axis and profit on the y-axis, the line clearly shows trends, growth, decline, and seasonality. This makes temporal patterns immediately visible."
    },
    {
        "question": "The data contains playlist information with multiple video URLs in an array. The user wants to watch them. What component?",
        "answer": "Use a **video-player** component with playlist support. For multiple videos, you need a player that can handle playlists, showing the current video with a list of other videos in the queue. Users can navigate between videos, and the player manages playback across the collection."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have customer satisfaction survey results as percentages for 'Very Satisfied', 'Satisfied', 'Neutral', 'Unsatisfied'. What chart type?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-donut** or **chart-pie** component. These categorical percentage distributions are perfect for donut/pie charts. Each satisfaction level becomes a slice, and users can immediately see the proportion of each category. Donut charts are preferred for a modern look and the ability to show a summary in the center."
    },
    {
        "question": "My data is a large array of transaction records with date, amount, category, and merchant. Users need to search and filter. What component?",
        "answer": "Use a **table** component with search and filter capabilities. Tables are best for large datasets with multiple fields that users need to search through. Add features like column sorting, filtering by category, date range selection, and search by merchant. This gives users powerful tools to find specific transactions."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have a single recipe object with title, image URL, ingredients array, and instructions. How should this be presented?",
        "answer": "Use a **one-card** component. Display the recipe as a card that includes the image (if image URL is available) at the top, followed by the title, ingredients list, and instructions. This creates a rich, organized presentation of all recipe information in one cohesive view."
    },
    {
        "question": "The data shows website traffic by hour for today for two websites. User wants to identify peak times. What visualization?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-line** component. For hourly data showing traffic patterns throughout a day, line charts make peaks and valleys obvious. The x-axis shows hours, y-axis uses two lines to show traffic count for both websites, and the line shape clearly indicates when traffic is highest and lowest."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an array of team member objects with name, role, photo URL, and email. The user wants to see the team. What component?",
        "answer": "Use a **set-of-cards** component. For team members with photos, cards provide an attractive way to display each person. Each card shows the photo prominently, along with name, role, and contact info. This is more engaging than a table and works well for people profiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "My data compares actual vs budgeted expenses across departments as {department, actual, budget}. What should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-mirrored-bar** component. When comparing two metrics across multiple categories, mirrored bars work perfectly. Each department gets two opposite bars for easy comparison. Budgets can be easily compared also between departments. But mirrored bar is not suitable for time-series data, so use a **chart-line** component instead."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have a single error message object with error code, message, and timestamp. How should I display this?",
        "answer": "Use a **one-card** component, specifically styled as an error card or alert. A card provides clear visual hierarchy for the error information, and you can style it with error colors (red) to grab attention. Display the error code prominently, the message clearly, and include the timestamp for context."
    },
    {
        "question": "The data is an array of movie objects with title, poster URL, rating, and description. User is browsing for something to watch. What component?",
        "answer": "Use a **set-of-cards** component. Movies are highly visual content where poster images are crucial. Cards allow each movie to show its poster prominently along with title, rating, and description. This creates an engaging browsing experience much better than a table would."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have age distribution data showing count of users in ranges: 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46+. What chart type?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-bar** component. For distribution across age ranges, bar charts are ideal. Each age range gets a bar showing the count, making it easy to see which age groups are most represented. Bar charts handle categorical ranges better than line charts and are clearer than pie charts for this purpose."
    },
    {
        "question": "My data is a single statistic object with value, label, and trend (up/down). How should this be shown?",
        "answer": "Use a **one-card** component, specifically a KPI or metric card. For single statistics, a card focused on the number works best. Display the value prominently, show the label, and use an icon or color to indicate trend direction. This creates a clean, scannable metric display."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an array of invoice records with invoice number, date, client, amount, and status. User needs to manage invoices. What component?",
        "answer": "Use a **table** component with action buttons. Tables are perfect for business records like invoices that have multiple fields and require management actions. Users can scan all fields, sort by date or amount, filter by status, and interact with actions like view, download, or email directly from the table."
    },
    {
        "question": "The data shows temperature readings throughout the day. User wants to see temperature variation. What UI component should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-line** component. Temperature over time is continuous data best represented by a line chart. The smooth line shows temperature changes throughout the day, making it easy to identify patterns like morning lows, afternoon highs, and evening cooling."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have a single product object with image URLs array, title, price, and description. The user is viewing product details. What components should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a **one-card** component. You can show first or random image at the top of the card. Below that, organize the product information (title, price, description). This provides both rich visual content and structured product details in an organized layout."
    },
    {
        "question": "My data shows revenue breakdown by region as percentages. User wants to see regional contribution. What chart?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-pie** or **chart-donut** component. Percentage breakdowns showing parts of a whole are perfect for pie/donut charts. Each region becomes a colored slice, instantly showing which regions contribute most to revenue. Donut charts are more modern and can display the total revenue in the center."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an array of 50+ product listings with multiple attributes. The user wants to find specific products quickly. What UI component?",
        "answer": "Use a **table** component with pagination, search, and filters. For large datasets where users need to find specific items, tables with robust search/filter capabilities are essential. Add pagination to handle the volume, column sorting for organization, and filters for attributes. This gives users powerful tools to narrow down and find what they need."
    },
    {
        "question": "The data contains a tutorial video URL and related text instructions. How should this learning content be displayed?",
        "answer": "Use a **video-player** component if user asks to watch the video. You can also use **one-card** component if user asks to read the instructions and indicate that video is available in the card."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have sales data by month for 3 different product lines. User wants to compare product performance over time. How to visualize the data?",
        "answer": "Use a **chart-line** component with multiple lines. When comparing trends across multiple categories over time, multi-line charts are ideal. Each product line gets its own colored line on the same chart, making it easy to compare their performance and see which is growing faster, seasonal patterns, and crossover points."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have an order object, containing info about the order and list of ordered products, shaped as an array of objects with name, price, description, thumbnail URL, and number of ordered pieces. User wants to see ordered products only. What UI component should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a **table** or **set-of-cards** component. If user wants to see ordered products only in a compact way, use a **table** component. If user wants to see ordered products in a more visual way, use a **set-of-cards** component."
