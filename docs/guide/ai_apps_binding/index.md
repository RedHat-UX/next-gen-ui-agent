Binding UI Agent core functionality into your AI application (AI assistant backend) can be achieved multiple ways.

## AI Framework bindings

* [Llama Stack](llamastack.md)
* [LangGraph](langgraph.md)
* [Embedded Llama Stack Server Inference](llamastack_embedded.md)
* [BeeAI](beeai.md) - Tech Preview

## AI Protocol bindings/servers

* MCP - WIP
* A2A - WIP
* [ACP](acp.md) - Tech Preview

## Python Library

There is also a [Python library with the core functionality](pythonlib.md) available, to integrate into other AI frameworks and application types.
