# Data UI Blocks

Next Gen UI Agent produces UI components for `InputData` passed to it, to visualize the data the best as possible. We call this output *Data UI Blocks*.

Different types of *Data UI Blocks* can be used, depending on how are UI components selected and configured. For now these types are available:

* [AI selected and configured dynamic components](dynamic_components.md)
* [Hand build components](hand_build_components.md)
