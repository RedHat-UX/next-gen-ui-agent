# Dynamic Components

These fully AI/LLM selected and configured dynamic *Data UI Blocks* are now supported by *UI Agent*. UI Agent selects UI 
component which matches best the current user prompt and [input data structure](../input_data/structure.md).

Optionally, this components can be [mapped per `InputData.type` and pre-configured in this mapping](../configuration.md#components-listagentconfigcomponent-optional),
LLM is not used/necessary in this case.

See details about [component selection and configuration process](index.md#selection-and-configuration-process).

## Components for [one `Object` input data](../input_data/structure.md#one-object-input-data)

### Card

Component identification: [`one-card`](../../spec/component.md#one-card)

Card is UI block that displays:

  * Title
  * Facts list
  * Image (if [image url is present in the input data](../input_data/structure.md#image-url) and selected to be shown)

Value can be simple text or number etc. List (array) of values is supported as well.
