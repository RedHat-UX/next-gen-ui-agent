* [LangGraph](ai_apps_binding_langgraph.md)
* [BeeAI](ai_apps_binding_beeai.md) - Tech Preview

## AI Protocol bindings/servers

* MCP - WIP
* A2A - WIP
* [ACP](ai_apps_binding_acp.md) - Tech Preview

## Python Library

There is also a [Python library with the core functionality](ai_apps_binding_pythonlib.md) available, to integrate into other AI frameworks and application types.
