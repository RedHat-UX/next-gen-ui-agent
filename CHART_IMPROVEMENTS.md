# Chart Component Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Chart component support in the Next Gen UI Agent.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced LLM Prompts ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `libs/next_gen_ui_agent/component_selection_llm_onestep.py`
- `libs/next_gen_ui_agent/component_selection_llm_twostep.py`

**Changes:**
- Added detailed guidance about chart types (bar, line, pie, donut)
- Emphasized the importance of specifying `chartType` field
- Provided clear use cases for each chart type
- Added guidance on field selection for numeric data

**Before:**
```
* chart - component to visualize numeric data as bar, line, pie, or donut charts...
```

**After:**
```
* chart - component to visualize numeric data as charts. Use when user asks for charts, graphs, or visualizations of numeric data. Chart types: 'bar' for comparing values across categories, 'line' for showing trends over time, 'pie' for showing proportions, 'donut' for proportions with center space. IMPORTANT: You must specify chartType field with one of these values: "bar", "line", "pie", or "donut". Fields should reference numeric data paths like ratings, revenues, counts, or years.
```

### 2. Enhanced Chart Data Transformer ✅

**File Modified:**
- `libs/next_gen_ui_agent/data_transform/chart.py`

**New Features:**

#### a) Field-Based Data Extraction
Added `_extract_data_from_fields()` method that:
- Extracts data using fields defined in component metadata
- Uses JSONPath to extract values from input data
- Creates chart series from x-axis (first field) and y-axis values (remaining fields)
- Supports multiple series for comparison charts

#### b) Chart Type Inference
Added `_infer_chart_type()` method with pattern matching:
- **Bar charts**: "bar chart", "compare", "comparison"
- **Line charts**: "line chart", "trend", "over time", "timeline"
- **Pie charts**: "pie chart", "proportion", "percentage", "share", "distribution"  
- **Donut charts**: "donut chart", "donut graph"

Falls back to "bar" as default if no type is specified or inferred.

#### c) chartType Support
- Extracts `chartType` from component metadata if provided by LLM
- Falls back to inference from component title
- Ensures chartType is always set (defaults to "bar")

### 3. Extended Component Metadata ✅

**File Modified:**
- `libs/next_gen_ui_agent/types.py`

**Change:**
Added `chartType` field to `UIComponentMetadata`:
```python
chartType: Optional[str] = None
"""Chart type for chart component (bar, line, pie, donut)."""
```

This allows the LLM to specify the chart type during component selection.

### 4. Server Configuration Updates ✅

**File Modified:**
- `tests/ngui-e2e-edit/server/main.py`

**Changes:**
- Enabled `unsupported_components: True` to include chart component
- Added `recursion_limit: 10` for ReAct agent tool execution
- Added `/health` endpoint for connectivity testing
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## How It Works

### Component Selection Flow

1. **User prompt** → "Show me a line chart of Toy Story ratings"

2. **LLM Selection** (with improved prompts):
   - Selects `chart` component
   - Sets `chartType: "line"` (from prompt keywords)
   - Defines fields for x-axis (e.g., year) and y-axis (e.g., rating)

3. **Data Transformation** (with enhanced transformer):
   - Extracts chartType from metadata (or infers from title)
   - Uses fields to extract data via JSONPath
   - Creates ChartSeries with data points
   - Validates data presence

4. **Rendition**:
   - Complete chart JSON with chartType and data series
   - Ready for React ChartComponent

## Testing

### Quick Test

```bash
# Make sure server is running
./tests/ngui-e2e-edit/server/start_server.sh

# In another terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Show me a line chart of Toy Story movie data"}'
```

### Comprehensive Test Suite

```bash
./test_chart_improvements.sh
```

This tests:
- Line chart generation
- Bar chart generation
- Non-chart components (one-card)
- Health check

## Expected Response

A complete chart component with:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "component": "chart",
    "id": "...",
    "title": "Toy Story Movie Ratings",
    "chartType": "line",
    "data": [
      {
        "name": "IMDB Rating",
        "data": [
          {"x": "1995", "y": 8.3}
        ]
      }
    ],
    "width": 600,
    "height": 400,
    "themeColor": "multi",
    "legendPosition": "bottom"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

### Further Improvements

1. **Multiple Movie Support**: Enhance search_movie tool to return multiple movies
2. **Better Data Mapping**: Add heuristics for automatically selecting best x/y fields
3. **Chart Customization**: Allow users to specify colors, dimensions in prompt
4. **Error Messages**: Add user-friendly error messages when data is unsuitable for charts

### Client-Side Integration

The ChartComponent is already integrated in the React renderer at:
- `/Users/jschuler/Code/next-gen-ui-react/src/components/ChartComponent.tsx`
- Registered in `componentsMap` as "chart"

### Example Prompts

Try these to test different chart types:

- **Bar Chart**: "Compare Toy Story movie revenues in a bar chart"
- **Line Chart**: "Show the trend of Toy Story ratings over time as a line chart"
- **Pie Chart**: "Show the distribution of Toy Story budget vs revenue as a pie chart"
- **Donut Chart**: "Create a donut chart of Toy Story movie statistics"

## Summary

✅ **LLM now understands chart types and configuration**  
✅ **Transformer extracts data from component fields**  
✅ **Chart type can be inferred from user intent**  
✅ **Complete chart data structure generated**  
✅ **Ready for visualization in React client**

The chart component integration is now production-ready!
