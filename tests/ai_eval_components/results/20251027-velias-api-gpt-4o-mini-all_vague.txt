Env: OpenAI API

Note:
* generally tends to put lots of fields into UI components
* for `image`, LLM selected one-card with image and other info multiple times, which might be reasonable in some cases
* for `one-card`, it selected `set-of-cards` in case of prompt against array of simple values, which can be also OK
* for `set-of-cards`, it generated field paths pointing to only one element in many cases, or even to first and second element, which is incorrect
* for `set-of-cards`, it was confuged by array placed next to object, and generated paths for that array inside of that object
* for `video-player`, it forgot to generate field pointing to the video url in 2 cases from 35 (fields was empty)
