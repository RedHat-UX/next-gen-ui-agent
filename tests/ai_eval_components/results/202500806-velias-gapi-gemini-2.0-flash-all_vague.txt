Note: 
* After data_path sanitizations improvement and data pickup improvements
* This model tends to select more fields to be shown if user prompt is more generic (not targeting any concrete info available in data) with our current system prompts.
* Some errors was data_paths like `$..0.name`
* Some errors was set-of-card instead of one-card for case when prompt asked for actors and array of acror names is in data, so this may be also interpretted as a valid response (each card showning one actor name).
