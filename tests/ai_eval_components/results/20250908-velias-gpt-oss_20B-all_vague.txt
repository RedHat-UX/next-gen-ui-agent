Components: all with vague component type check
LLM: gpt-oss 20B
Env: local ollama

Note: 
* Performance was very poor due to insufficient GPU and "reasoning" type of LLM
* "image" - 4 errors are LLM error with empty `fields`, once `one-card` has been selected which is not fully incorrect due to the nature of the Prompt
* "one-card" - 4 cases is due to bad sanitization of paths like "movie['languages[size up to 6]']" and "movie['countries[size up to 6]']"
* "one-card" and "table" - warning is for object directly in array cases, where LLM put `data` into path which is incorrect
* for generic "info" prompts over single item data, it tends to put a lot of fields into component
* never selected a table as it looked at real num of items in array, rather than size info from our optimization - prompt change necessary
