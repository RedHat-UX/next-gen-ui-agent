Components: all with vague component type check
LLM: Qwen3 14B
Env: Server API

Note: 
* in many cases (30+2 errors), LLM ignored instructions, and generated longer text with "thinking". Correct JSON was part of output after `</think>` tag. Unfortunatelly 
  that thinking contained JSON examples so our JSON output sanitization was not able to pick up the correct final JSON as it took the first one.
  Updated LLM output sanitization based on `</think>` tag helped to parse output correctly for these cases.
* that one 'image' error might be interpretted as correct as one-card was selected showing image and info which kinda matches prompt
* some data structures, mainly array next to the object, confused it and generated value path was incorrect (array path but put into that object)
* is able to select `table` prety well if array is wrapped in field
